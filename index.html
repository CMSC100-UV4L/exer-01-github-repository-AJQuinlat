                    <h3>Favorite CMSC subject</h3>
                    <p>
                        My favorite CMSC subject is CMSC 22 since this really helped me 
                        make sense of object-oriented programming and its vital pillars
                        such as abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

                    <h3>Favorite GE</h3>
                    <p>
                        Math 10 is my favorite GE since it helped me build up my foundations
                        in my course and relate Mathematics to myself and the world i live in.

                    <p>
                        Python is easy and fun to use and I expect to use it more in the future when
                        I learn all about data science and machine learning.

                        Eating peanut butter sandwiches has been my go to activity when stressed or just don't
                        have anything to do. It is delicious and filling at the same time!
